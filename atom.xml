    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Disclaiming your irritation with my tangents:</h2>

<p>I consider it a fair assumption that anyone who has found themselves in a position to be reading this, has likely been led here by the influence of hearing me speak perviously, or recommendation of someone who has. Because of that, I am comfortable exposing you to the rambling nature of my thoughts.</p>

<h2>The Interrogative Particles:</h2>

<p>Who: In short, no one of consequence. Historically I&rsquo;ve worked as a systems administrator and professional services engineer. Early on I learned that my job had little to nothing to do with what I already knew, and considerably more to do with how I reacted to discovering more things I did not know.</p>

<h3>Anthropomorphizing One&rsquo;s self:</h3>

<h4>The engineer&rsquo;s inner struggle between humility and arrogance (Or the sociology paper no one will ever write.)</h4>

<p>In terms of personality, software engineering has some remarkably awkward and humorous traits. In most situations it seems as if there are very few ways technologists are viewed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Venerated technology genius: All the people who know more about anything than you do, so long as you have no real experience with them. They will most definitely tell you upon direct questioning, that they are not particularly smart, they&rsquo;ve just been &ldquo;doing this for a while&rdquo;, &ldquo;have read a lot of books&rdquo; or &ldquo;know a lot of smart people, and just seem better for it&rdquo;. Often this presents itself as a near frustrating amount of self deprecation.</li>
<li>Assholes : Do you have strong opinions about the technology you spend your entire professional life working on (or explaining to people)? Do you disagree with nearly anyone, ever (or probably everyone, always)? Do you struggle with the use of words like exactly, equivalent and impossible? Are you not only capable, but think it entirely normal to have impassioned arguments with another person, and once it&rsquo;s resolved (usually agreed to be abandoned) move on as if no argument took place? Guess what, you&rsquo;re almost certainly considered an asshole by at least some large group of people you work with.</li>
<li>Useless: If you haven&rsquo;t written a number of books, given countless talks, authored a number of surprisingly useful open source projects or founded a successful software company and somehow still managed to not collect a list of people who think you&rsquo;re an asshole you likely aren&rsquo;t doing anything. (In that case, someone probably thinks you&rsquo;re an asshole for that.)</li>
</ul>


<p>What: Maybe nothing more than a proving ground for presentation topics. Maybe a place to complain about technical and non-technical problems.</p>

<p>Why: In short, I gave a talk at a community event, and it opened the flood gates of requests to talk at other events. I repeat myself very frequently based on my poor memory for what I&rsquo;ve already said to particular people. As such, I don&rsquo;t feel like anyone benefits from me giving the same talk multiple times, particularly if it&rsquo;s been recorded and hosted somewhere. That sounds great, but I don&rsquo;t like making slide decks, and often need to sort through ideas in long form. My wife doesn&rsquo;t appreciate the nuances of very long discussions on the merits of pry.</p>

<p>My money&rsquo;s in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain&rsquo;t there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I&rsquo;m gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I&rsquo;m gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I&rsquo;m talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?</p>

<blockquote><p>Blockquote is what goes
inside this block here
would you believe that
bullshit?</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&rsquo;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&rsquo;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&rsquo;t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother&rsquo;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>

<p>Your bones don&rsquo;t break, mine do. That&rsquo;s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don&rsquo;t get sick, I do. That&rsquo;s also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We&rsquo;re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>

<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that&rsquo;s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you&rsquo;re in a toy store, because you&rsquo;re here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
